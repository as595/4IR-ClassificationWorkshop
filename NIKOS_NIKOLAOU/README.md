Here are the slides of my talk in .pdf format, plus some additional slides and references:
[Imbalanced Data Full Final.pdf](https://github.com/as595/4IR-ClassificationWorkshop/files/1498719/Imbalanced.Data.Full.Final.pdf)

I also provide a [link to a tutorial on some of my own research on cost-sensitive boosting algorithms](https://github.com/nnikolaou/Cost-sensitive-Boosting-Tutorial). As discussed in my talk, there are many learning algorithms each making its own set of assumptions regarding the data and the decision boundary it constructs. Boosting is but one such family of learning algorithms.  In fact it is a family of 'meta-learning algorithms', meaning it can be used in conjunction with any other 'base learning algorithm' to 'boost its performance' (increase its accuracy). As also mentioned in the talk, cost-sensitive learning is one of the many weapons we have for attacking imbalanced class problems. With that in mind, the methods described in this tutorial might or might not work well in a given problem.
